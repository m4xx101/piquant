It's a most efficient Wordlist generator for Password cracking which has ability to do followings :

- Switch between the inuted words.
- It has feature to make all possible passwords with/without special charachters as user define.
- I've used most comman technique or you can say pattern for creating password list, by anlyzing pattern most of the peoples uses to set their password.
- It also ask for Birth date as a input since most of the people uses birth date in their passwords. 
- Finally boom it creates aprox 25k unique password (Specifiy about 3 words for best results.)
